This package is effectively sunfreeware SMClintl relocated to /opt/sfw.

You can build it yourself by more or less

wget SMClintl.pkg.gz
pkgtrans SMClintl.pkg.gz ./
cd SMClintl
edit pkginfo with a new location, pkgmap with new size & checksum
pkgtrans SMClintl SMClintl-blah.pkg
gzip SMClintl-blah.pkg

I wasn't motivated enough to track down the source and build. It seems like
libintl was part of GNU gettext?
